# Centre for Advanced Machine Learning and Applications (CAMLAs)
Official website of our lab. Our LAB is dedicated to machine learning for real-life problems. Our research focuses on developing computer vision, image processing, and bioinformatics models from big data by developing machine learning, statistical methods, and algorithms. Our aims are twofold: to contribute to the modeling process's automation and make discoveries in real life. Our researchers and students pursue studies of, among others, video data, medical image data, transcriptome data, mutation and DNA modification data, metabolomics, screening, and clinical data in cancer and viral diseases.

The lab collaborates worldwide with researchers in machine learning, computer vision, medical image processing, bioinformatics, and computational biology. We participate in a highly interdisciplinary project on complex diseases and have established collaboration with China, USA, Australia, UK, and Bangladesh.
